Pheanstalk is a pure PHP 7.2+ client for the [beanstalkd workqueue][1].  It has
been actively developed, and used in production by many, since late 2008.

Created by [Paul Annesley][2], Pheanstalk is rigorously unit tested and written
using encapsulated, maintainable object oriented design.  Community feedback,
bug reports and patches has led to a stable 1.0 release in 2010, a 2.0 release
in 2013, and a 3.0 release in 2014.

Pheanstalk 3.0 introduces PHP namespaces, PSR-1 and PSR-2 coding standards,
and PSR-4 autoloader standard.

In 2018 [Sam Mousa][3] took on the responsibility of maintaining Pheanstalk.

Pheanstalk 4.0 drops support for older PHP versions. It contains the following changes (among other things):
- Strict PHP type hinting
- Value objects for Job IDs
- Functions without side effects
- Dropped support for persistent connections
- Add support for multiple socket implementations (streams extension, socket extension, fsockopen)


beanstalkd up to the latest version 1.10 is supported.  All commands and
responses specified in the [protocol documentation][4] for beanstalkd 1.3 are
implemented.

Installation with Composer
-------------

Install pheanstalk as a dependency with composer:

```bash
composer require pda/pheanstalk
```


Usage Example
-------------

```php
<?php

// Hopefully you're using Composer autoloading.

use Pheanstalk\Pheanstalk;
// Create using autodetection of socket implementation
$pheanstalk = Pheanstalk::create('127.0.0.1');

// ----------------------------------------
// producer (queues jobs)

$pheanstalk
  ->useTube('testtube')
  ->put("job payload goes here\n");

// ----------------------------------------
// worker (performs jobs)

$job = $pheanstalk
  ->watch('testtube')
  ->ignore('default')
  ->reserve();

echo $job->getData();

$pheanstalk->delete($job);

```


Running the tests
-----------------

If you have docker-compose installed running tests is as simple as:
```sh
> composer test
```

If you don't then you manually need to set up a beanstalk server and run:
```sh
> vendor/bin/phpunit
```
